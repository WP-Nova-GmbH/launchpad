# Source Control Integrations

Launchpad connects to your Git hosting provider so you can create pull requests, review code, and manage repositories without leaving the app.

## Supported Providers

Launchpad works with the platforms your team already uses:

- **GitHub** – Pull requests, repository creation, and clone integration
- **GitLab** – Merge requests, repository publishing, and hosted clones
- **Bitbucket** – Pull request workflows (via API token authentication)
- **Azure DevOps** – Pull request support for Microsoft-hosted repositories

## What You Can Do

### Start Projects from Anywhere

**Clone repositories directly**

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) → **Add Project**
- Choose **GitHub repository**, **GitLab repository**, **Bitbucket repository**, **Azure DevOps repository**, or paste any **Git URL**
- Enter the repository path (`owner/repo`, `group/project`, `workspace/repository`, or `project/repository`) or a full Git URL, pick a destination, and start coding
- GitHub clones use HTTPS with the GitHub CLI's sign-in for credentials, so `gh auth login` on the machine running Launchpad is all a clone needs — no SSH key required. A pasted Git URL is cloned exactly as written.

**Publish local projects to the cloud**

- Have a local Git repository without a remote?
- Use the **Publish Repository** action to create a new hosted repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps), add it as your origin remote, and push, in one flow
- If the local repository has no commits yet, publishing creates the remote and wires it up but does not push. Make a commit, then push normally.

### Manage Code Reviews Without Context Switching

**Create pull requests while you work**

- Push a branch and create a pull request from the Git actions controls in the toolbar
- Launchpad can suggest titles and descriptions based on your commits
- Supports GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests, Bitbucket Pull Requests, and Azure DevOps Pull Requests

**Stay on top of open reviews**

- See if your current branch already has an open PR/MR
- Open several reviews from the **Pull requests** page as tabs in the right panel
- While working in a thread, open linked reviews in the same compact right-panel tabs without
  leaving the conversation
- Open the review directly in your browser with one click
- Command-click (Control-click on Windows and Linux) a pull request number in the sidebar to open it in your browser instead of in Launchpad
- Check out a teammate's branch to review code locally

**Fix what you wrote, in place**

- Rewrite a pull request's title and description from the review itself, in Markdown, with a
  preview before you save
- Rewrite your own comments the same way, wherever they are shown
- Works on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Azure DevOps takes a new title and description; its
  comments stay read-only here, as they already were

### Know Your Setup at a Glance

The **Source Control settings** page shows you exactly what's connected:

- ✅ Which providers are authenticated and ready
- ⚠️ What's missing and how to fix it
- 👤 Which account is signed in (when available)

Run a quick **Rescan** after setting up a new machine or changing credentials.

## Getting Started

### For GitHub (Recommended for most users)

1. Install the GitHub CLI on the machine running Launchpad:
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```
2. Sign in:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Open **Settings → Source Control** in Launchpad and verify GitHub shows as authenticated

You can now clone, publish, and create pull requests.

None of this is needed on an organization's managed executors. Once an admin has connected
GitHub in **Settings → Organization**, executors clone, push, and open pull requests with the
organization's GitHub App installation, and Source Control shows GitHub as authenticated through
it. Work done that way is authored by the App, and it reaches exactly the repositories the App was
installed on.

### For GitLab

1. Install the GitLab CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install glab
   ```
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   glab auth login
   ```
3. Check **Settings → Source Control** to confirm the connection

### For Bitbucket

Bitbucket uses tokens instead of a CLI tool. Two options, both set as environment variables on the
machine running Launchpad.

Recommended, a Bitbucket access token:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Or an Atlassian account email plus API token, with read/write access to pull requests and
repositories, plus read access to your user account (`read:user:bitbucket`, used to verify the
connection):

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

If both are set, the access token wins. Restart Launchpad and verify the connection in **Source
Control settings**.

### For Azure DevOps

1. Install Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```
2. Add the DevOps extension:
   ```bash
   az extension add --name azure-devops
   ```
3. Sign in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

## Requirements & Troubleshooting

**Git is required** – Launchpad uses Git for all local operations. Ensure `git` is installed on your server.

**Server-side setup** – Authentication happens on the machine running Launchpad (the server), not your local browser. If you're using a hosted or team instance, your administrator may have already configured providers.

**Common issues:**

- **Provider shows "Not authenticated"** – Run the login command for that provider (e.g., `gh auth login`) in a terminal on the server, then rescan in Settings
- **Bitbucket not connecting** – Double-check your environment variables are set in the correct shell profile and the server was restarted
- **Can't push to a remote** – Verify your Git remote URL matches the provider you've authenticated with (SSH vs HTTPS remotes may need different credentials)
- **Clone says the remote rejected this machine's credentials** – The machine running Launchpad is the one doing the cloning. For GitHub, sign in with `gh auth login` there; for a pasted SSH URL, that machine needs an SSH key registered with the host
- **Clone fails on an organization executor** – Executors use the organization's GitHub App installation, not a personal sign-in. Check that GitHub is connected in **Settings → Organization** and that the App has access to that repository with at least read permission on its contents
